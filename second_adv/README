Start index.js for listening call.start and call.stop messages.

call.start messages:
1. are being validated;
2. are being inserted to Couch if no errors have occured or being moved to 'retry' queue otherwise;
3. are being acknowledged after processing complete.

call.stop messages:
1. are being validated;
2. are being used to search matching call.start message in Couch
3. are being merged with found call.start message doc if no errors have occured or being moved to 'retry' queue otherwise;
4. are being acknowledged after processing complete.


Have fun))

//TODO
Listening to 'retry' and 'reject' queues are not implemented yet. 

=======
All files should be started in different terminals.

1. Start cons_start.js to create Consumer for listening call.start messages (inserting in DB)
2. Start cons_stop.js to create Consumer for listening and processing call.stop messages 
(selecting matching start msg, merging, updating doc in Couch);
